# To-do List

This is a mini project used to refresh my React and Redux skills, and also to experience some new approaches.

### Features

1. Create react structure using webpack and babel
2. Apply redux-thunk to handle async requests to the server, while having react components focusing on display data
3. Build a simplified local server using express.js
4. Use `connect()` to connect react components with redux store, instead of using `useSelector` and `useDispatch`
5. Apply **Redux-Persist** to preserve store data, instead of creating custom hook re local storage
